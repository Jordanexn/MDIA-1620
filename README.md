**Three 'Aha" Moments** 
1. Github is the interface- the marrionette whereas Git is the puppet master 
2. Computers require a high level of specificity when being given instructions
3. folders are all directories, the verbiage helps humans compartmentalize but it does not translate to computers.

**Two unclear things**
| # | Unclear Thing |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | the "code" in markdown cheatsheet- I thought code was entered in git not github |
| 2 | the purpose of navigating through all the directories in terminal |

# #1 answer: 
github allows you to gode and view the changes made simultaneousy

# 3rd lesson 3-2-1's 
**3 'aha' moments**
1. When facing errrors, its important to closely inspect syntax, small errors make a huge impact but theyre easily resolved 
2. It is important to be -within- the folder of the file you're working on and not looking at it within its parent's folder r you will have issues
3. Numbers, strings, and bouleans are all formatted specifically so that the computer excecutes the comands in the proper context of the data. wrong format= wrong excecution 

**2 unclear things**
|#| Unclear Thing |
|---------- | ----------|
|1| What camelscript and the snake script are and their purpose |
|2| if I rename my files will i have to mirror that change in the repository/terminal too or do I "commit to update" |

**1 word for how i'm feeling**
- hopeful
