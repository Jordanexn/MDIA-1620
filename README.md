**Three 'Aha" Moments** 
1. Github is the interface- the marrionette whereas Git is the puppet master 
2. Computers require a high level of specificity when being given instructions
3. folders are all directories, the verbiage helps humans compartmentalize but it does not translate to computers.

**Two unclear things**
| # | Unclear Thing |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | the "code" in markdown cheatsheet- I thought code was entered in git not github |
| 2 | the purpose of navigating through all the directories in terminal |

# #1 answer: 
github allows you to gode and view the changes made simultaneousy
